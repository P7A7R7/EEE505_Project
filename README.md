# EEE505_Project
Project data and code for EEE505: Time-Frequency Signal Analysis.


1. Adaptive Array of Lienard-type Intermittent Oscillators (ALI) for instantaneous frequency estimation in high noise environment as described by [Time-frequency high-resolution for weak signal detection using chaotic intermittence (Costa et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsp.2023.104160).

2. Adaptive STFT-based Synchrosqueezing Transform for noisy multicomponent signal TF representation as described by [Adaptive short-time Fourier transform and synchrosqueezing transform for non-stationary signal separation (Li et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2019.07.024).

3. Adaptive CWT-based Synchrosqueezing Transform similar to above as described by [Adaptive synchrosqueezing transform with a time-varying parameter for non-stationary signal separation (Li et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acha.2019.06.002).

Code for (1) obtained from [here](https://codeocean.com/capsule/9015585/tree/v1) 

MATLAB routines for (2) and (3) as available [here](http://www.cs.umsl.edu/~jiang/Jsoftware_SST.htm)
